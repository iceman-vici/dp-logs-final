# Webhook Implementation Changelog

## Summary

Added complete webhook support to receive real-time call events from Dialpad. This provides an alternative to API polling, enabling real-time call data processing with JWT authentication for security.

## Date: October 3, 2025

## New Features

### 1. Webhook Endpoint
- **POST /webhook** - Main endpoint for receiving Dialpad call events
- **GET /webhook/health** - Health check endpoint
- **GET /webhook/stats** - View webhook processing statistics
- **POST /webhook/stats/reset** - Reset statistics counters
- **GET /webhook/logs** - View recent webhook processing logs
- **POST /webhook/test** - Test endpoint (development only)

### 2. JWT Authentication
- Implemented JWT signature verification middleware
- Supports HS256 algorithm
- Configurable secret key via environment variables
- Automatic token expiration handling

### 3. Database Support
- New `webhook_logs` table for audit trail
- Views for webhook statistics and activity monitoring
- Cleanup function for old logs maintenance
- Same database structure as API sync method

### 4. Real-time Processing
- Immediate call data processing upon webhook receipt
- Automatic upsert of calls, contacts, users, and recordings
- Transaction support for data consistency
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Documentation
```
README.md                                     # Added webhook documentation
```

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2",
  "express-rate-limit": "^7.1.5"
}
```

## Configuration

### New Environment Variable
```bash
WEBHOOK_SECRET=dp_call_logs  # Must match Dialpad webhook configuration
```

### Dialpad Webhook Configuration
```json
{
  "webhook": {
    "hook_url": "https://dp-call-logs.iceman.systems/webhook",
    "id": "5212604609576960",
    "signature": {
      "algo": "HS256",
      "secret": "dp_call_logs",
      "type": "jwt"
    }
  }
}
```

## Database Schema Changes

### New Tables
- **webhook_logs**: Stores all webhook events with processing status and full payload

### New Views
- **webhook_stats_view**: Daily statistics for webhook processing
- **webhook_recent_activity**: Recent webhook activity with call details

### New Functions
- **cleanup_old_webhook_logs(days)**: Maintenance function for log cleanup

## Security Features

1. **JWT Authentication**: All webhook requests must include valid JWT token
2. **Signature Verification**: Verifies HS256 signature using shared secret
3. **Token Expiration**: Automatic handling of expired tokens
4. **Payload Size Limit**: 10MB limit for webhook payloads
5. **Rate Limiting**: Webhooks exempt from rate limiting for reliability

## API Behavior Changes

### Rate Limiting
- Webhook endpoints are now exempt from rate limiting
- API endpoints continue to use rate limiting
- Configurable via environment variables

### Body Parser
- Increased payload size limit to 10MB to accommodate webhook payloads
- Supports both JSON and URL-encoded bodies

### Server Root Endpoint
- Added root endpoint (/) that displays all available endpoints
- Includes both API and webhook endpoint documentation

## Migration Steps

### For Existing Installations

1. **Pull latest changes**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Update environment configuration**
   ```bash
   # Add to .env
   WEBHOOK_SECRET=dp_call_logs
   ```

3. **Install new dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run database migration**
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d dialpad_logs \
     -f /app/database/migration-webhook-logs.sql
   ```

5. **Restart services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

6. **Test webhook**
   ```bash
   bash scripts/test-webhook.sh
   ```

### For New Installations

Follow the updated README.md instructions. The webhook functionality is included by default.

## Testing

### Automated Testing
Run the test script to verify webhook functionality:
```bash
bash scripts/test-webhook.sh
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test health
curl http://localhost:3001/webhook/health

# View stats
curl http://localhost:3001/webhook/stats

# Test with sample data (dev only)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/webhook/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @docs/examples/webhook-payload-example.json
```

## Monitoring

### Webhook Statistics
Access via API: `GET /webhook/stats`

Returns:
- Total webhooks processed
- Successful webhooks
- Failed webhooks
- Success rate percentage

### Webhook Logs
Access via API: `GET /webhook/logs?limit=50`

Returns recent webhook processing events with:
- Call ID
- Processing status
- Error messages (if any)
- Full payload (for debugging)
- Timestamp

### Database Queries
```sql
-- View daily statistics
SELECT * FROM webhook_stats_view;

-- View recent activity
SELECT * FROM webhook_recent_activity LIMIT 20;

-- Find failed webhooks
SELECT * FROM webhook_logs 
WHERE status = 'failed' 
ORDER BY processed_at DESC;
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Non-blocking Processing**: Webhook processing uses async/await patterns
2. **Transaction Support**: Database operations use transactions for consistency
3. **Efficient Indexing**: Added indexes on webhook_logs for fast queries
4. **Log Cleanup**: Built-in function to cleanup old logs

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ All existing API sync functionality remains unchanged
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing endpoints
- ✅ Database schema additions are backward compatible
- ✅ Environment variables are optional (defaults provided)

## Known Limitations

1. Test endpoint (`/webhook/test`) only available in development mode
2. Webhook logs grow over time (use cleanup function periodically)
3. JWT tokens must not be expired (standard JWT behavior)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- [ ] Webhook event filtering by type
- [ ] Webhook retry mechanism for failed processing
- [ ] Webhook rate limiting (if needed)
- [ ] Webhook payload validation schemas
- [ ] Real-time webhook dashboard
- [ ] Webhook event replay functionality

## Support

For issues or questions about the webhook implementation:
1. Review the [Webhook Setup Guide](WEBHOOK_SETUP.md)
2. Check the [Quick Reference](WEBHOOK_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
3. Run the test script: `bash scripts/test-webhook.sh`
4. Check webhook logs: `curl http://localhost:3001/webhook/logs`
5. Open an issue on GitHub
